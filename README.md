Actual conversation (with typos corrected) from #stationx on freenode about how I need to write a README

```
theophani: so the key thing to google is "jekyll github pages"
theophani: I had never heard of it before either
theophani: and spent 2.5 hours being super frustrated that I could not figure out how
           to edit the site after @janl set it up for me.
theophani: he would have helped, if I'd asked.
theophani: warning: the actual github pages help are not helpful.
fnords:    i will use my google-fu to figure it out
theophani: intro: https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages
theophani: actual help: https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/blob/master/README.textile
theophani: premise: if you have a branch named gh-pages, you automatically create
           github pages for the repo. if you want to have a blog, you can have JUST
           a branch called gh-pages
fnords:    aha!
ln2v:      oh, so they don't actually go into master?
theophani: exactly
theophani: I should copy and paste this conversation as the readme :D
ln2v:      feel free! ;)
