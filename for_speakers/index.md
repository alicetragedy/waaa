# {{ page.title }}

Do you wish that the conferences and the user groups you attend had more speakers like you? I have a quick fix for you: **become one**. Show people what *you* want in a speaker. Lead by example.

**We are all awesome. You included.** Maybe you donâ€™t feel so awesome right now, but I plan to convince you otherwise, and to help you.

## How to get on stage

I've built a collection of articles to help and motivate you:
